 * This class represents a single node in a nodegraph.
 * Links between nodes are implemented in the Node itself (through a list of connections).
 * This means that if node A and B are connected, A will have B in its connections list and vice versa.
 * This is also called a bi-directional connection.
 * 
 * Some items are specific to this example, such as position since this node represents a node in a 
 * navigation graph. A node in a boardgame for example might represent completely different data, 
 * such as the current state of the board.
